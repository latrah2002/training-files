Think about this:

Honestly, that's how most people learn. Now, I am sorry to say that there is no make website button regardless
 of which tool you use. So, the obvious question becomes, where do I start? Well, more than anything else, that's 
going to be driven by two things, which areas of web design that you plan to specialize in? And what your current
 strengths are? What interests you more? Visual design, user experience, interactive design or mobile development? 
Are you currently a graphic designer, technical writer, instructional designer, educator? Take some time to think 
through those choices and be honest about your current strengths.
