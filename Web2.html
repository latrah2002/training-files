						<P>This article distinguishes between serif and sans-serif fonts and discusses when each is appropriate.
					</DIV>

					<P>Consider the following characters. The first is set in Georgia, a lovely serif
					font. The second is set in Verdana, an easy-to-read sans-serif font.

					<TABLE CLASS="indented">
						<TR>
							<TD><IMG SRC="images/serif.gif"    HEIGHT=90 WIDTH=90 ALT="serif"></TD>
							<TD><IMG SRC="images/sanserif.gif" HEIGHT=90 WIDTH=90 ALT="sans-serif"></TD>
						</TR>
						<TR>
							<TD> &nbsp;  &nbsp; serif</TD>
							<TD> &nbsp;  &nbsp; sans serif</TD>
						</TR>
					</TABLE>

					<P>Notice the small decorative flourishes at the ends of the strokes in the left
					character. These are called <em> serif.</em> The right character does not have these
					strokes and is said to be a <em>sans-serif</em> font. (<em>Sans</em> is the French
					word for <em>without.</em>)

					<P>Times New Roman is a commonly used serif font. Arial is a commonly used
					sans-serif font.

					<H2>Use serif for printed work</H2>

					<P>Serif fonts are usually easier to read in printed works than sans-serif fonts.

					<P>This is because the serif make the individual letters more distinctive and easier
					for our brains to recognise quickly. Without the serif, the brain has to spend
					longer identifying the letter because the shape is less distinctive.

					<P>The commonly used convention for printed work is to use a serif font for the body
					of the work. A sans-serif font is often used for headings, table text and captions.

					<H2>Use sans serif for online work</H2>

					<P>An important exception must be made for the web. Printed works generally have a
					resolution of at least 1,000 dots per inch; whereas, computer monitors are typically
					around 100 dots per inch. Even Apple's much vaunted retina display is only around 300
					dots per inch &mdash; much lower than print.

					<P>This lower resolution can make small serif characters harder to read than
					the equivalent sans-serif characters because of their more complex shapes.

					<P>It follows that small on-screen text is better in a sans-serif font like Verdana
					or Arial.
